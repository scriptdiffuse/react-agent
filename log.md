### LangGraph Platform Deployment Configuration

**Changes Made:**

1. **Updated `langgraph.json`** - Added `environment_variables` array to specify required environment variables for LangGraph platform deployment:
   - `TAVILY_API_KEY` - Required for the search tool functionality
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Required when using Anthropic models (default: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Required when using OpenAI models

**Purpose:**

- Configure the codebase for deployment on LangGraph platform where environment variables can be managed through the UI
- Ensure proper environment variable handling for different model providers and tools

**Files Modified:**

- `langgraph.json` - Added environment_variables configuration
- `log.md` - Created to track development changes
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Created comprehensive deployment guide for LangGraph platform

**Next Steps:**

- Deploy to LangGraph platform and configure environment variables in the UI
- Test that environment variables are properly loaded from the platform UI rather than local .env file
- Follow the deployment guide in DEPLOYMENT.md for step-by-step instructions
